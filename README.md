***How this works?***

```
This is a privacy focused chat application. The messages are not stored and logged anywhere in the system. 

The server is just a mediator.

Since we're not storing anything (so no store and forward), users needs to be online to chat. If an user send a message and then refresh the page, the user won't see anything on the screen. 

So chat and forget!
